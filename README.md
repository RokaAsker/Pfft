this is for practice not for full user satisfaction

repo: Pfft
Author: Roka Asker
what it is:
A simple app that will allow users for a small guild to have some fun.
This is to help me develop as a programmer and as a project leader if the need arises.

things going in at start:
	-user based schedule
		Req:
			Event start times for daily weekly or monthly
			A User will be allowed to enter an event and on the calender it will show who started it and the time it will run (start to end)
			A User will be warned that another event will be at the same time as the one they are trying to enter
			The event will be stored as green when the correct number of people has been reached (eg 8/8 or 4/4)
			The event will be stored as red if the number of people is over the maximum (eg 9/8)
			A user can leave a note as to if they need a time ext or request event to be on another day
	-shopping list
		Req:
		For now this will be a small user defined list, they will set the items and how many they need and will be able to click the item on the list if they have the correct amount.
	-email option for other users
		This is a possibility that might not be added more information will be needed before this is inplemented.
			Users can enter an email address when making an account (possible text message through email)
			Option will be able to be turned off or on based on user setting
			A user can select another user on an event to email or text.
			A User can only email if they have email set up in order for the receiver to respond.
